## Recap:
Methods are a set of codes that executes some operations. Methods can be 
parameterized or non-parameterized methods depending on whether arguments 
are passed. A method declaration should always have a returntype. If the 
method does not return anything it is called a void method.

In java, the methods are of type call-by value. This is because even when an 
object is passed as an argument, only a copy of its value is passed.

#### Input from a User:

In java, we can write codes where a user can provide the input during the 
execution. Java provides built-in methods for the same. This can be done via:

1. Scanner class:  
2. BufferedReader and InputStreamReader classes:
  This will be handled later once we complete exception handling.


#### String:

String class is provided by java. String literals contain alphanumerics
(alphabets, numbers, symbols)within double quotes. Strings are objects in java.

Ex:
```ruby 
String name = "Veena";
String nums = "12456";
```

Here, the variable 'nums' declared as a string can never be used as an integer 
value,ie, no mathematical operations can be done on it.

## What is a programming language?
A programming language is a medium to create the instructions which helps to find a logical solution to any problem statement.

### Examples of programming language: 
Basic, C, C++, Java, Haskell, Scala etc.

## How does the computer system understand a programming language?
The computer system only understand binary language which is composed of 0 and 1.
For an end user writing such a program is cumbersome. Hence, users write the program in templates which are converted to machine understandable language by the compilers and interpreters. These templates are called as "code".

## How is code written?
The code can be written in any programming language like the ones already mentioned. This code must adhere to certain semantics and syntax which is specific to the programming language. As already mentioned the code is a template, so there is a defined structure to the template which must be followed. This is the Syntax of the code.
